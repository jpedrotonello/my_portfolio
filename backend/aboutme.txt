I’m an AI engineer and data scientist who approaches problems the same way I approached mathematics as a kid: by breaking them down step by step until the underlying structure becomes obvious. My instinct is always to understand the problem first. Once the structure is clear, the technical solution presents itself almost inevitably. This mindset keeps my work grounded in logic rather than trend-chasing and helps me avoid the illusion of progress that comes from “pretty outputs” with no real business value.

In real-world AI work, uncertainty is the default state, and I treat it as something to be managed deliberately, not feared. When I built the NL2SQL system for executives—the Genie—progress came from systematic experimentation: controlled tests, curated human feedback loops, careful contextualization, and iterative refinement. Over time, this process pushed accuracy from an unreliable baseline to consistently high performance. The same philosophy guided the MVP I built for subrogation (auto insurance recovery): the priority was to stop the bleeding quickly while maintaining technical discipline, then incrementally improve the system as evidence came in. Speed and rigor don’t have to be enemies when you design the right feedback loops.

My principles are stable across projects: measurable precision over superficial polish; strong governance, auditability, and compliance (especially in regulated industries); and a genuine concern for bias, robustness, and interpretability. These aren’t buzzwords in my work—they’re constraints that shape architecture, data strategies, and guardrails from the start.

I’ve always been deeply academic by nature. I love studying, and mathematics has been my strongest talent since childhood. Numerical calculus in university was a turning point: it bridged my passion for mathematical modeling with the emerging world of data science. That connection felt natural, almost obvious. I pursued Automation and Control Engineering specifically because it had the highest mathematical load of all programs—differential equations, modeling, dynamic systems. That background still defines the way I reason about AI systems today.

Outside of work, I’ve always followed my curiosity widely. I’ve played piano since childhood. I’m a licensed drone pilot and have built and programmed hobby robots at home—I’ve been coding since the age of fifteen. Languages are another long-running fascination: I taught myself German at fourteen using free courses from Deutsche Welle, and today I speak English, Spanish, and German in addition to my native Portuguese.

My interests spill into the sciences as well. As a hobby, I study paleontology, physiology, pharmacology, and biochemistry simply because understanding how complex systems function is endlessly satisfying.

I also love nature and adventure. I’ve gone skydiving, flown in a hot-air balloon, and explore remote places with my drone to capture aerial footage. I have a kayak and enjoy spending time outdoors whenever possible. Sports have always been part of my life too—rugby, volleyball, tennis—and I currently cycle about 50 km a week.

At the core, I’m someone who enjoys mastering complex systems, building things that work, and constantly expanding the range of what I understand. AI engineering just happens to be the perfect intersection of everything I’ve always been drawn to.
