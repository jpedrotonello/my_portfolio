PERSONAL INSIGHTS AND PHILOSOPHY

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with AI and data science. Beyond the technical skills, here's what drives me:

WORK PHILOSOPHY
- I believe in shipping high-impact solutions quickly, then iterating based on feedback
- I prefer pragmatic approaches over perfect solutions that never ship
- I value clear communication and translating complex technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders
- I'm deeply committed to building systems that are not just accurate, but also interpretable and trustworthy

WHAT I ENJOY MOST
- Working on problems where AI can directly impact business metrics
- Mentoring junior engineers and sharing knowledge
- Building end-to-end systems from problem definition to production deployment
- Collaborating with cross-functional teams (product, business, engineering)

LEARNING MINDSET
- I'm constantly learning new technologies and methodologies
- I contribute to open-source projects when possible
- I stay updated with the latest developments in AI/ML through research papers and industry discussions

OUTSIDE OF WORK
- I'm interested in the ethical implications of AI and responsible AI practices
- I enjoy reading about technology, business, and philosophy
- I'm based in São Paulo, Brazil and love the tech community here

UNIQUE STRENGTHS
- Combination of deep technical AI knowledge with strong business acumen
- Ability to communicate complex ML concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences
- Proven track record of delivering production-grade systems that generate measurable business value
- Experience working in regulated industries (insurance) where compliance and governance are critical
